## Project Vision
To create an innovative, AI-powered mobile application that revolutionizes language learning by providing personalized, interactive Hindi language tutoring for English speakers. The application will serve as a virtual language tutor that listens to users' conversations, encourages Hindi speaking practice, provides real-time corrections, and adapts difficulty levels based on the user's progress.

## Project Mission
Our mission is to break down language barriers and make Hindi language learning accessible, engaging, and effective through the use of advanced AI technologies. By creating a mobile application that simulates natural conversation practice with intelligent feedback, we aim to accelerate language acquisition and build user confidence in speaking Hindi.
